# Maricopa-County-Biodiversity-Intactness-Index

In 2021, Maricopa County, which encompasses the Phoenix metropolitan area, was the US county that added the most developed land since 2001. Urban sprawl creates pressure on biodiversity and natural areas. We will explore a dataset showing values for a biodiversity intactness index (BII) to find changes in this BII around the Phoenix area from 2017 to 2020.
